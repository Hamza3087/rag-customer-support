Internet connectivity: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. CloudSync requires consistent connectivity for real-time sync.\n\n2. Application status: Check that CloudSync is running by looking for the cloud icon in your system tray (Windows) or menu bar (macOS).\n\n3. Storage space: Verify sufficient storage on both local device and CloudSync account. Free accounts are limited to 5GB total.\n\n4. File conflicts: Look for files with conflict indicators (usually marked with device names). Resolve conflicts by choosing the correct version.\n\n**Advanced Troubleshooting:**\n5. Pause and resume: In Settings menu, click 'Pause Sync' wait 10 seconds, then click 'Resume Sync'.\n\n6. Restart application: Completely close CloudSync (right-click system tray icon > Exit) and restart it.\n\n7. Clear local cache: Go to Settings > Advanced > Clear Local Cache. This will re-download all synced files.\n\n8. Check sync logs: Navigate to Settings > Advanced > View Logs to identify specific error messages.\n\n9. Firewall/antivirus: Ensure CloudSync is allowed through your firewall and antivirus software.\n\n**When to Contact Support:**\nIf sync issues persist after trying all steps above, contact support with your log files and a description of the problem. Include your operating system, CloudSync version, and approximate number of files being synced."
